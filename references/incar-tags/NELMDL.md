# NELMDL
NELMDL = \[integer\] 

|  |  |  |
|----|----|----|
| Default: **NELMDL** | = -12 | if [ISTART](ISTART.md)=0, [INIWAV](INIWAV.md)=1, and [IALGO](IALGO.md)=48 or [IALGO](IALGO.md)=50 |
|  | = 0 | if [WAVECAR](../input-files/WAVECAR.md) is present |
|  | = -5 | else |

Description: NELMDL specifies the number of non-self-consistent steps at
the beginning.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

If the orbitals are initialized using a random number generator (the
default in VASP), the initial orbitals are usually unreasonable and the
iterative matrix diagonalization will require 5-10 steps to obtain
reasonable orbitals. The charge density corresponding to the initial
orbitals is also, at best, erratic. It is hence advisable to perform a
few electronic steps while keeping the initial Hamiltonian fixed. This
initial Hamiltonian is usually determined from a superposition of atomic
charge densities (see [ICHARG](ICHARG.md)).

Such a 'delay' is absolutely necessary if the SCF-convergence is slow
and problematic (e.g. for surfaces or metallic clusters, low dimensional
system). Without a delay, VASP will most likely not converge, or at
least the convergence speed is slowed significantly.

NELMDL might be set to a positive or negative value. A negative value
means that the delay is only performed in the first ionic step (usually
the recommended option). A positive number means that a delay is
employed after each ionic movement. This can improve the convergence
speed in VASP.6 (see below) but is not recommended in VASP.5.

For calculations using a direct minimization of the Hamiltonian
([ALGO](ALGO.md)=ALL or [ALGO](ALGO.md)=DAMPED), the
Davidson algorithm is used during the delay phase and the Hamiltonian is
kept fixed during these steps.

Special considerations for VASP.6:

- For calculations using a direct minimization of the Hamiltonian
  ([ALGO](ALGO.md)=ALL or [ALGO](ALGO.md)=DAMPED):
  if NELMDL is set, the Davidson algorithm is used in the first NELMDL
  steps as described above. Using a positive NELMDL (i.e. delay in every
  ionic step) does not work reliably in VASP.5, due to issues in the
  orbital and charge density prediction. In VASP.6, using NELMDL=1 (or
  NELMDL=2) and direct minimization often improves the stability and
  efficiency of molecular dynamics simulations or relaxations
  ([ALGO](ALGO.md)=ALL or [ALGO](ALGO.md)=DAMPED).
  Note, however, that this might require one to prepare a reasonable
  [WAVECAR](../input-files/WAVECAR.md) file since NELMDL =1/2 might not
  suffice to obtain a reasonable set of orbitals from the initial random
  numbers.

&nbsp;

- For HF-type calculations, if NELMDL is larger or equal to 3, VASP will
  perform NELMDL non-selfconsistent steps using the Davidson algorithm,
  and a local Hamiltonian is calculated using the semi-local DFT
  functional corresponding to the chosen hybrid functional (i.e. PBE for
  HSE and PBE0). This is expedient if the ions move by a large distance
  between the ionic steps. Setting NELMDL =3 can thus improve the
  stability and performance during relaxations using HF-type
  Hamiltonians. Try to use [ALGO](ALGO.md)=All and NELMDL=3 if
  you encounter convergence issues during relaxations using HF-type
  Hamiltonians.
