# MAXMEM
MAXMEM = \[integer\]  
Default: **MAXMEM** = 2800 (VASP.5.4.4. and older), automatically set as
of VASP.6 

Description: MAXMEM specifies the maximum memory one MPI rank will
attempt to allocate (in MByte). Since, the default varies somewhat
between VASP versions, it is safer to set this flag manually. Currently
the flag is only inspected in few selected routines, such as the GW or
RPA routines that can use excessive amounts of memory. It is recommended
to set MAXMEM to the available memory per core minus 200 Mbyte. For
instance, if one node is equipped with 12 Gbyte, and 6 MPI ranks share
this memory, the recommended setting is 12\*1024/6-200 = 1848.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

As of VASP.6 the default value of MAXMEM is set to 90 percent of the
available memory per MPI rank. If more than one compute node is used,
the minimum of all nodes is used. The available memory in RAM is
estimated by searching the file "/proc/meminfo" for the entry
"MemAvailable:". Note that "/proc/meminfo" is present on any Linux
system and stored in RAM. In case that the file cannot be found, MAXMEM
is set to 2800.
