# RWIGS


RWIGS = \[real array\]  
Default: **RWIGS** = -1 

Description: RWIGS specifies
the Wigner-Seitz radius (in $\AA$) for
each atom type.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

- RWIGS *has* to be supplied
  for each atom type if [LORBIT](LORBIT.md) is set to \<10.
  In this case, the *spd*- and site projected wave function character of
  each band is evaluated, and the local partial DOS (see sections
  [PROCAR](../output-files/PROCAR.md) and [DOSCAR](../output-files/DOSCAR.md))
  and local magnetic moments are calculated.

<!-- -->

- If [LORBIT](LORBIT.md) \>= 10,
  RWIGS is ignored

<!-- -->

- RWIGS *must* be set in
  calculations with constraining the local magnetic moments (see
  [I_CONSTRAINED_M](I_CONSTRAINED_M.md))

For **mono-atomic systems**
RWIGS can be defined
unambiguously. The sum of the volume of the spheres around each atom
should be the same as the total volume of the cell (assuming that you do
not have a vacuum region within your cell). This is in the spirit of
atomic sphere calculations. VASP writes a line

    Volume of Typ   1:     98.5 %

to the [OUTCAR](../output-files/OUTCAR.md) file. You should use a
RWIGS value which yields a
volume of approximately 100%.

For systems consisting of **more than one atom type**, there is no
unambiguous way to define
RWIGS and several choices are
possible. In all cases, the sum of the volume of the spheres should be
close to the total volume of the cell (i.e the sum of the values given
by VASP should be around 100%).

- One possible choice is to set
  RWIGS such that the overlap
  between the spheres is minimized.

<!-- -->

- a more elaborate way is to apply a Bader-type charge analysis to
  estimate the radius of an atom in a specific compound.

<!-- -->

- in most cases, it is simplest to choose the radius of each sphere such
  that they are close to the covalent radius as tabulated in most
  periodic tables. This simple criterion can be used in most cases, and
  it relies at least on some \`\`physical intuition*.*

Please keep in mind that results are **qualitative** i.e. there is no
unambiguous way to determine the location of an electron (and hence the
local magnetic moments). With the current implementation, it is for
instance hardly possible to determine charge transfer. What can be
derived from the partial DOS is the typical character of a peak in a
DOS. Quantitative results can be obtained only by careful comparison
with a reference system (e.g. bulk versus surface).
