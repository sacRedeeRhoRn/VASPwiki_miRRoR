# INCAR
The INCAR file is the central input file of VASP, which determines *what
to do and how to do it*. The [INCAR
tags](../redirects/Category-INCAR.md) specified in the INCAR file
select the algorithms and set the parameters that VASP uses during the
calculation. VASP will use reasonable default values, which we recommend
using when unsure. Yet, the settings in the INCAR file are the main
source of errors and false results, so we suggest carefully checking the
meaning of the set [INCAR tags](../redirects/Category-INCAR.md).
Regarding the format, each statement consists of the name of a tag, the
equal sign **=**, and the values assigned to the tag (tag = values). For
instance, an INCAR file for a density-functional-theory calculation
might read

      ALGO  = Normal # alorithm for electron optimization
      ISMEAR= -1     # Fermi smearing
      SIGMA = 0.05   # width of the smearing in eV

| **Tip:** VASP writes its interpretation of the data in the INCAR file to the [OUTCAR](../output-files/OUTCAR.md) file. Please verify that it agrees with the intended setup. |

## Format
The INCAR file is a tagged format free-ASCII file. That is, each
statement follows a *tag = values* syntax. Typically, each line contains
a single statement, but it is possible to combine multiple statements on
a single line, separating them by a semicolon **;**, e.g.,

      ISMEAR= -1 ;  SIGMA = 0.05

For better readability, long lines can be split with a backslash **\\**
. Avoid blanks after the backslash because some versions of VASP cannot
parse those. For instance,

      MAGMOM  = 0 0 1.0 0 0 -1.0 \
                0 0 1.0 0 0 -1.0 \
                6*0 

is the same as

      MAGMOM  = 0 0 1.0 0 0 -1.0 0 0 1.0 0 0 -1.0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Alternatively, enclose all the values in quotes **"** to ignore line
breaks between the quotes, e.g.,

      WANNIER90_WIN = "
      Begin Projections
      Si:sp3
      End Projections
      "

Some newer features of VASP use nested tags (e.g.
[KERNEL_TRUNCATION/LTRUNCATE](../incar-tags/KERNEL_TRUNCATION__LTRUNCATE.md)
or [PLUGINS/STRUCTURE](../incar-tags/PLUGINS__STRUCTURE.md)).
You can either specify these tags directly like

      KERNEL_TRUNCATION/LTRUNCATE = T

or use curly braces to encapsulate multiple ones to avoid repeating the
prefix

      PLUGINS {
         STRUCTURE = T
         NEIGHBOR_CUTOFF = 5.0
      }

This syntax is also used to set specific tags on specific
[IMAGES](../incar-tags/IMAGES.md).

For comments, VASP ignores any text after a hashtag **\#** or
exclamation mark **!**. Use this to add comments anywhere to the INCAR
file. A comment prefix (#!) is often unnecessary because VASP ignores
all text that does not fit the statement format (tag = values). In this
case, do not use any syntax relevant character (=;") because it may
break the parsing of the INCAR file. VASP generally ignores empty lines,
but we have encountered issues due to lines with tabs for some
compilers.

A typical (relatively complex) INCAR:

    SYSTEM = Rhodium surface calculation

    start parameters for this Run (automatic defaults, hence not often required)
      ISTART =      0    #  job   : 0-new  1- orbitals from WAVECAR
      ICHARG =      2    #  charge: 1-file 2-atom 10-const

    electronic optimization
      ENCUT  = 300.00 eV # defaults from POTCAR, but wise to include
      ALGO  =  Normal    # alorithm for electron optimization, can be also FAST or ALL
      NELM   = 60        # of ELM steps, sometimes default is too small 
      EDIFF  = 1E-06     # stopping-criterion for ELM
    ! broadening and DOS related values; this works almost always
      SIGMA  =    0.05;  ISMEAR =  0   ! broadening in eV, -4-tet -1-fermi 0-gaus

    ionic relaxation
      EDIFFG =  -1E-02   # stopping-criterion for IOM (all forces smaller 1E-2)
      NSW    =  20       # number of steps for IOM
      IBRION =  2        # CG for ions, often 1 (RMM-DISS) is faster
      POTIM  =  .5       # step for ionic-motion (for MD in fs)
    performance optimization
      KPAR   =    4      # make 4 groups, each group working on one set of k-points 
      NCORE  =    4      # one orbital handled by 4 cores 
      LREAL  =    A      # real space projection; slightly less accurate but faster
